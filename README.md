# MastermindGame

### Introduction ###
I built the game as a web app by using Spring Boot. I used Java to build the backend (setting difficulty level and getting the random number conbination). For the frontend, I use JSP page with some simple css styling as well as a JavaScript file to handle the game implementation logic (comparing the result, reducing the number of attempt, and checking if the user win).

### How to Run the App ###
Download the app with the command "git clone https://github.com/mubinbin/MastermindGame.git". After downloading, run "**cd MastermindGame**" command in Shell or Windows Command Prompt in your current folder to go into the app folder. And then run "**./mvnw spring-boot:run**" in Shell (or "**mvnw spring-boot:run**" in Windows Command Prompt). When the Spring Boot project is up and running, type in **http://localhost:8080/** in your web browser and you should be able to use the app.
